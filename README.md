# Bulletin by BlueLine
Bulletin is a case management system developed in coordination with the Nebraska State Patrol. Currently, there is no centralized, digital source of truth for case updates or task management. This tool was created to fill that gap, modernize the Patrol, create transparency throughout the organization, and ensure that everyone is acting on the most up-to-date information.

Bulletin was developed in Fall 2019 as a part of UNL's Innovation Processes course that is part of the Raikes School curriculum. Over the course of the semester, my group of team members and I developed a business model using the Lean Startup methodology. As a proof-of-concept for the business models, we developed this prototype and refined it with feedback from the Nebraska State Patrol.
